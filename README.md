Tools and templates for setting up Garden Enterprise.

## Terraform for setting up infrastructure for Garden Enterprise (in progress)

Terraform code for setting up the resources on AWS, GCP and Azure is planned. At this point only Azure is available, but stay tuned.

## Vault set-up

In the Vault directory there is a script that automates Vault set-up for
the [bundled Vault in Garden Enterprise](https://enterprise.docs.garden.io/getting-started/installation#initialize-bundled-vault-optional).
You can run this script once you have installed Garden Enterprise via KOTS.
