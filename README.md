Tools and templates for setting up Garden Enterprise.

## Vault set-up

In the Vault directory there is a script that automates Vault set-up for
the [bundled Vault in Garden Enterprise](https://enterprise.docs.garden.io/getting-started/installation#initialize-bundled-vault-optional).
You can run this script once you have installed Garden Enterprise via KOTS.
